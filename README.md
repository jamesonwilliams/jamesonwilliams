# Hello

I'm currently working as a senior engineer on [AWS' mobile team](https://docs.amplify.aws/start/q/integration/android). I helped create the [Amplify Android](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android) project, and contribute regularly to [our documentation](https://github.com/aws-amplify/docs).

I've been at Amazon for a few years. Before AWS' Mobile team, I worked on [Alexa's Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app). And even before that, I worked on the original launch team for [AWS' Simple Systems Manager (SSM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html).

Here are some other places you can find me on the Internet:
