# Hello

I'm a Staff Software Engineer. I previously worked at Amazon for 5 years. There, I helped create the [Amplify Android](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android) project, worked on [Alexa's Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.amazon.dee.app), and contributed to the [AWS' Simple Systems Manager (SSM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-automation.html) launch.

You can find me on [nosemaj.org](https://nosemaj.org), [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jamesonwilliams), [dev.to](https://dev.to/jameson), and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/695787/jameson).
